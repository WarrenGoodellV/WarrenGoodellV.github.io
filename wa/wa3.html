   <p><strong>Michael Benjamin Bay</strong> (born February 17, 1965)[1] is an American film director and 
    producer. He is best known for making big-budget, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_concept">high-concept     </a> action films characterized 
    by fast cutting, stylistic cinematography and visuals, and extensive use of special effects,
    including frequent depictions of explosions.[2][3] The films he has produced and directed, 
    which include <i>Armageddon (1998)</i>, <i>Pearl Harbor (2001)</i> and the <i>Transformers film series 
    (2007–present)</i>, have grossed over US$7.8 billion worldwide, making him one of the most 
    commercially successful directors in history.[4][5]</p>
    <p>He is co-founder of commercial production house The Institute, a.k.a. The Institute for 
    the Development of Enhanced Perceptual Awareness.[6] He co-owns Platinum Dunes, 
    a production house which has remade horror films, including The <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre
    (2003)</i>, <i>The Amityville Horror (2005)</i>, <i>The Hitcher (2007)</i>, <i>Friday the 13th (2009)</i> and 
    <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010)</i>.[7]</p>
    <p>Despite his commercial success at the box office, Bay's work is generally held in 
    low esteem by film critics. <i>While The Rock (1996)</i>, <i>Transformers (2007)</i>, <i>13 Hours: 
    The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (2016)</i>, <i>and Ambulance (2022)</i> received moderately 
    positive reviews, most of his other films, particularly the four <i>Transformers</i> sequels, 
    have been received negatively by critics.</p>

    <h2 id="earlyLife">Early Life</h2>
    <p>Bay was born in Los Angeles. He was raised by his adoptive parents Harriet, a bookstore 
    owner and child psychiatrist, and Jim, a CPA.[8] He was raised Jewish.[9][10][11] 
    His grandfather was from Russia.[12] His cousin, Susan Bay, is the widow of <i>Star Trek</i> 
    actor Leonard Nimoy (whom he eventually cast as the voice actor for Sentinel Prime in 
    <i>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</i>).[13] He attended the exclusive Crossroads School in Santa 
    Monica, California.[14]</p>
    <p>Bay often traces his interest in action films back to an incident during his childhood. 
    As a boy, he attached some firecrackers to a toy train and filmed the ensuing fiery 
    disaster with his mother's 8 millimeter camera. The fire department was called and he 
    was grounded.[15]</p>

    <h2 id="carrer">Carrer</h2>
    <p>Bay got his start in the film industry interning with George Lucas when he was 15, 
    filing the storyboards for <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>, which he thought was going to be 
    terrible. His opinion changed after seeing it in the theater and he was so impressed 
    by the experience that he decided to become a film director.[16] He graduated from 
    Wesleyan University in 1986, majoring in both English and film.[17][18] He was a member 
    of the Psi Upsilon fraternity and a favorite student of film historian Jeanine Basinger.
    [19] For his graduate work, he attended Art Center College of Design in Pasadena where 
    he also studied film.[20]</p>
    <p>Bay began working at Propaganda Films, directing commercials and music videos, two weeks 
    after finishing his postgraduate degree.[20] His 90-second World War II–inspired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola </a>
    advertisement was picked up by Capitol Records. His first national commercial was for the 
    Red Cross, which won a Clio Award in 1992.[21][22] He directed Goodby, Silverstein & 
    Partners' "Got Milk?" ad campaign for the California Milk Processors Board in 1993, which 
    also won a Grand Prix Clio Award for Commercial of the Year.[23][24]</p>
    <p>Bay's success in music videos gained the attention of producers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Bruckheimer">Jerry Bruckheimer</a> and 
    Don Simpson, who selected him to direct his first feature-length film, <i>Bad Boys</i>. It was 
    shot in Miami in 1994 and starred Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. The action film was a 
    breakout role for Smith, who was making a transition from television at the time. Shooting 
    in Miami was a good experience for Bay, who would later own a home in the city and spend a 
    great deal of time there.[25] The film was completed for $19 million and grossed a 
    remarkable $141 million in the summer of 1995.[26] Bay's success led to a strong 
    partnership and friendship with Jerry Bruckheimer.[27]</p>
    <p>His follow-up film, <i>The Rock (1996)</i>, an action movie set on Alcatraz Island and in the 
    San Francisco Bay area, starred Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris. It was 
    produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, the latter of whom died five months 
    before its release. The film is dedicated to him.[28] Connery and Cage won 'Best 
    On-Screen Duo' at the MTV Movie Awards in 1997, and the film was nominated for an 
    Academy Award in the Best Achievement in Sound category for the work of Greg P. Russell, 
    Kevin O'Connell and Keith A. Wester.[29][30] After the success of The Rock, Bay 
    established his production company Bay Films, with a two-picture deal with Disney.</p>
    <p>In 1998, Bay again collaborated with Jerry Bruckheimer, this time as a co-producer, as 
    well as directing the action-adventure film <i>Armageddon</i>.[31][32] The film, about a group of 
    tough oil drillers who are sent by NASA to deflect an asteroid from a collision course with 
    Earth, starred Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler. It was nominated 
    for four Oscars at the 71st Academy Awards, including Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, 
    Best Sound Editing and Best Original Song.[33] It earned $9.6 million on its opening day 
    and $36.5 million through the first weekend.[34] Its budget of $140 million was one of the 
    highest of the summer of 1998. It went on to gross over $553 million worldwide, the 
    highest-grossing film of that year.[35]</p>
    <p>In 2001, Bay directed <i>Pearl Harbor</i>, starring Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale 
    and Cuba Gooding, Jr. It was released on Memorial Day weekend in 2001, again produced by 
    Bay with Jerry Bruckheimer. It received four Academy Award nominations, including Best 
    Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Editing and Best Song. Kevin O'Connell received 
    another nomination for Best Sound, but did not win. <i>Pearl Harbor</i> won in the category for 
    Sound Editing, making it Bay's first (and, to date, only) film to win an Oscar.[36] Bay 
    also directed the music video for the nominated track "There You'll Be" by vocal artist 
    Faith Hill.[20]</p>
    <p>Bay reteamed with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence for <i>Bad Boys II</i>, a sequel that was Bay's 
    fifth collaboration with Jerry Bruckheimer. It grossed $138 million domestically, enough to 
    cover the production budget, and $273 million worldwide, almost twice as much as the first 
    movie. In 2005, Bay directed <i>The Island</i>, a science fiction film starring Ewan McGregor and 
    Scarlett Johansson. It was the first film Bay made without Jerry Bruckheimer as a producer. 
    It cost $126 million to produce and earned $36 million domestically and $127 million 
    overseas, for a total of $163 million. Bay said that he was not comfortable with the 
    domestic marketing campaign, as it confused the audience about the film's true subject.
    [37]</p>
    <p>In 2007, he teamed up with executive producer Steven Spielberg to direct <i>Transformers</i>, 
    a live action film based on the <i>Transformers</i> franchise. Released in July 2007, by November 
    of that year it had made over $709 million worldwide.[38]</p>
    <p>Bay returned as director and executive producer for <i>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</i>, 
    which was released on June 24, 2009 and grossed over $832 million worldwide. Although it 
    received mostly negative reviews by critics,[39] including aggressively critical reviews 
    by American film critics such as Roger Ebert,[40] Michael Phillips[41] and David Denby 
    (who referred to Bay as "stunningly, almost viciously, untalented"),[42] the film was 
    well received by its intended audience and one of the highest-grossing of 2009.[43][44] 
    In 2010, it earned seven Golden Raspberry Award nominations, and won three: Worst 
    Picture, Worst Director and Worst Screenplay.[45] It was also one of the best selling 
    DVD and Blu-ray Discs of 2009, second only to Twilight in DVD format, and the #1 of all 
    time in Blu-ray format until it was surpassed by Blu-ray sales of James Cameron's Avatar 
    in April 2010.[46][47][48]</p>
    <p>Bay directed <i>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</i>, released on June 29, 2011,[49] which 
    grossed $1.123 billion globally.[50] His next film was a comparatively small one he had 
    been developing for years, called <i>Pain & Gain</i>.[51] The true crime story, based on events 
    described in a Miami New Times article[52] by Pete Collins, concerns a group of bumbling 
    bodybuilders working together to commit a robbery.[53] It starred Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne 
    Johnson, Anthony Mackie, Tony Shalhoub and Ed Harris.</p>
    <p>Bay produced DreamWorks' I Am Number Four, based on a series of novels by Pittacus Lore 
    published by HarperCollins Children's Books. D. J. Caruso (Eagle Eye, Disturbia) 
    directed.[54][55]</p>
    <p>A fourth Bay-directed <i>Transformers</i> movie, <i>Transformers: Age of Extinction</i>, was released 
    in June 2014.[56] Starring Mark Wahlberg, it earned $1.1 billion at the global box 
    office.[57] On January 12, 2016, Paramount Pictures released 13 Hours, which Bay 
    produced and directed, based on the 2012 Benghazi attack. While the lowest-grossing 
    film of Bay's career at the box office, it went on to massive DVD sales on its digital 
    release in May 2016, earning over $40 million in home video revenue.[58]</p>
    <p>On May 23, 2017, Bay was honored with his own hand-and-footprint ceremony at The TCL 
    Chinese Theatre. His <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Mastiff">English mastiff</a>, Rebel, put her paw in the cement with him.[59]</p>
    <p>Bay's fifth Transformers film as director, <i>Transformers: The Last Knight</i>, was released 
    on June 21, 2017.[60] It grossed $68.5 million in its five-day North American opening 
    weekend, the franchise's lowest opening, and $605 million worldwide.[61][62] In a 2016 
    interview with Rolling Stone, Bay said it would be his final Transformers film as director.
    [63]</p>
    <p>In 2018, it was announced that Bay would direct the Netflix action thriller film 6 
    Underground, starring Ryan Reynolds, Mélanie Laurent, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Adria Arjona, 
    Corey Hawkins, Ben Hardy and Dave Franco.[64] It was released on December 13, 2019.[65] 
    In August 2019, Bay signed to direct the action film <i>Black Five</i> for Sony Pictures.[66] 
    However, the film, which was set to begin production in 2020, was put on hold because of 
    the COVID-19 pandemic, and Bay subsequently moved on to direct Ambulance.[67]</p>
    <p>Bay produced the pandemic-themed thriller Songbird starting Demi Moore, Craig Robinson, 
    Paul Walter Hauser and Peter Stormare.[68] He is set to direct the dystopian thriller 
    <i>Little America</i>, which was scheduled to film in California sometime in 2020.[69]</p>
    <p>In 2021, it was reported that Bay requested financial compensation from film studio 
    Paramount Pictures for indirectly limiting his income as a result of Paramount cutting the 
    theatrical-only run of <i>A Quiet Place Part II</i> from 90 to 45 days due to the effects of the 
    COVID-19 pandemic. Bay, and other producers as well as actors for the film, as is typically 
    the case, receive payment in part based on box-office performance, and a reduction in the 
    theatrical run's exclusivity affected the pay they received.[70]</p>
    <p>Bay's next film was 2022's <i>Ambulance</i>, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, 
    and Eiza González. It follows two bank robbers who hijack an ambulance and take two 
    hostages. Shot during the COVID-19 pandemic in Los Angeles,[71] it was released in the US 
    on April 8, 2022 by Universal Pictures.[72]</p>
